# Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on textual reviews using various methods, including VADER and the Hugging Face transformer model, RoBERTa. It focuses on analyzing customer reviews, extracting sentiment scores, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
1. Load a dataset of reviews from a CSV file.
2. Perform basic text processing, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
3. Use **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**, a pre-built sentiment analysis tool, to generate sentiment scores for each review.
4. Use the **RoBERTa** transformer model, a state-of-the-art language model, for sentiment classification.
5. Visualize the results using seaborn and matplotlib to understand the sentiment distribution across the reviews.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.
- `transformers`: For using pre-trained models like RoBERTa for sentiment analysis.
- `tqdm`: For progress bars during iterations.

## Installation

To run this project, you need the following libraries installed. Use the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk transformers tqdm
```

Additionally, you may need to install `torch` for the transformer model:

```bash
pip install torch
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of reviews from Amazon. It includes the following columns:

- `Id`: Unique identifier for the review.
- `Text`: The review text.
- `Score`: The star rating (1-5) given by the reviewer.

The data is loaded from a CSV file, and only the first 500 rows are processed.

## Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

The project begins by loading the CSV file and exploring the structure of the data. The count of reviews for each star rating (1-5) is visualized using a bar plot.

### 2. Text Preprocessing

We process the review text using NLTK:
- Tokenization: Split text into individual words.
- Part-of-speech tagging: Classify words into parts of speech.
- Named Entity Recognition: Identify named entities like names of people or places.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis using VADER

VADER is used to calculate sentiment scores for each review:
- `pos`: Positive sentiment score.
- `neu`: Neutral sentiment score.
- `neg`: Negative sentiment score.
- `compound`: A combined score representing the overall sentiment.

The sentiment scores are visualized in a bar plot, showing the distribution of sentiment for each star rating.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis using RoBERTa

We use the RoBERTa model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library to calculate sentiment scores for each review. This model is specifically trained for sentiment analysis tasks on social media texts.

The results from RoBERTa are compared with the VADER results for analysis.

### 5. Visualization and Analysis

We visualize the sentiment scores from both VADER and RoBERTa using pairplots and bar plots. This allows us to explore the correlation between the sentiment scores and the star ratings.

### 6. Example Predictions

The pipeline function from Hugging Face is used to make sentiment predictions on new sentences like "I love sentiment analysis!" and "Make sure to like and subscribe!" to see how well the model performs on different types of text.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example of using VADER for sentiment analysis
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
sia.polarity_scores("I am so happy!")

# Example of using RoBERTa for sentiment analysis
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
from scipy.special import softmax

MODEL = "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(MODEL)

text = "I love sentiment analysis!"
encoded_text = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
output = model(**encoded_text)
scores = output[0][0].detach().numpy()
scores = softmax(scores)
scores_dict = {
    'roberta_neg' : scores[0],
    'roberta_neu' : scores[1],
    'roberta_pos' : scores[2]
}
print(scores_dict)
```

### Visualizations

- **Sentiment Distribution by Star Rating**: A bar plot showing the sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative, and compound) for each review star.
- **Pairplot**: A pairplot comparing the VADER and RoBERTa sentiment scores for different star ratings.

### Key Insights

- **Sentiment Analysis**: The sentiment scores from VADER and RoBERTa provide a quantitative measure of the review sentiment.
- **Visualizations**: The visualizations help identify patterns, such as the correlation between the review score and sentiment.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the effectiveness of sentiment analysis for understanding customer feedback. By leveraging both VADER and RoBERTa, we gain insights into the overall sentiment of product reviews and can make data-driven decisions based on customer sentiments.
